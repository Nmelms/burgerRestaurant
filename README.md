# Burger Bun
Welcome to the Burger Bun repository! This website is a sample brochure site for a fictional burger restaurant called Burger Bun. This site allows users to browse the menu, view pictures, and learn more about the restaurant, such as its store hours.

In creating this project, my goal was to build a simple and effective website for a small business. To achieve this, I used vanilla JavaScript and relied on Bootstrap for styling assistance. The result is a clean, responsive, and user-friendly site that showcases the restaurant's offerings and information.
